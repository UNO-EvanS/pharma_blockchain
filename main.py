A blockchain, which is a decentralized digital ledger where transactions are recorded.
The data is immutable (cannot be changed) and is distributed across multiple devices.
This blockchain will track the path of pharmaceutical products.
This is a real world application, since pharmaceuticals can sometimes be spiked with fentanyl or carry diseases.
